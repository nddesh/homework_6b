Extra work:
As my three core pages, I create my home page, menu page and about page.

Since my website design includes all product details to be on one page as a tabbed interface, all of my product pages are incorporated into one. So, I created the functionality of all of these product details and made sure that only one product's details are seen at once. For this, I used javascript event listeners and classes with CSS properties to hide details of objects that were not clicked.

I also created the login page and added functionality to it, using concepts similar to the menu page. This page was changed due to heuristic evaluation.
